# ENGR454_Buck_Converter

Check out our Wiki for Full Documentation
Disclaimer: this project is still under revision and needs many corrections to model, simulation, and implementation. This project was implemented using an Arduino nano. In future revisions, we reccomend using a microcontroller that has a faster response time. In addition, investigation into the 3rd order model of the buck converter is needed. Lastly, research into incorporatng functionality of the buck converter in discontinous conduction mode is needed.
